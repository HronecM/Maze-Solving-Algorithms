# Maze-Solving-Algorithms
Display of speed and efficiency of different path finding algorithms\
Maze can be inputed through either a text file where:  
. = Empty tile  
\# = Wall tile  
S = Start tile  
X = End tile  

Or through a Bitmap where: 
black(0,0,0) = Wall tile  
white(255,255,255) = Empty tile 
red(1-254,0,0) = Start tile 
red(0,1-254,0) = End tile  
or with two empty spaces in the outer walls with start and end selected randomly 

It is assumed all input mazes are solvable and have a single end and single start
