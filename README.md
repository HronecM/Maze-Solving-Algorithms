# Maze-Solving-Algorithms
Display of speed and efficiency of different path finding algorithms\
Maze can be inputed through either a text file where:  
. = Empty tile  
\# = Wall tile  
S = Start tile  
X = End tile  

Or through a Bitmap with two empty spaces in the outerwalls which get assigned as Start and End randomly or through user input
It is assumed that all input mazes are solvable
