# Maze-Solving-Algorithms
Display of speed and efficiency of different path finding algorithms\
Maze can be inputed through either a text file where:  
. = Empty tile  
\# = Wall tile  
S = Start tile  
X = End tile  

Or through a Bitmap with a red start and green enter or with two empty spaces in the outer walls with start and end selected randomly

It is assumed all input mazes are solvable and have a single end and single start
